# Predictive-Modelling-for-Cervical-Cancer-Risk-Assessment
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess the risk of cervical cancer using machine learning techniques. The model will analyze various medical and demographic features to predict the likelihood of an individual developing cervical cancer. This can be instrumental in early detection and preventive healthcare measures.

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</b> Gather and preprocess relevant datasets that include features related to cervical cancer risk such as age, sexual history, smoking habits, HPV status, etc.</li>
<li><b>Feature Selection:</b> Identify and select the most significant features that contribute to cervical cancer risk.</li>
<li><b>Model Development:</b> Develop and train various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVMs, neural networks) to predict cervical cancer risk.</li>
<li><b>Model Evaluation:</b> Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to determine the best-performing model.</li>
<li><b>Deployment:</b> Deploy the best model in a user-friendly application that can be used by healthcare professionals to assess risk in real-time.</li>
  </ul>
